## About Data Force
    Data Force is a decentralized data marketplace application, running on a EVM blockchain network. This application provides users with a means to store data truly private, with no central access given to anyone, even the application owners. Users can also choose to monetize their data, by selling it for a fixed price, or a subscription model for growing data. It can also be used as a secure private cloud. Made a secure server which takes in a ML models and trains it with decentralized data from IPFS without revealing the actual dataset content and returns a trained model with its analysis.

### Features implemented
✔️ File encryption, and upload to IPFS

✔️ Secure transmission of private keys across network

✔️ Uploading unique image ID with decrypt key to the smart contract

✔️ Managing access to different files among various users

✔️ Ability to sell and purchase files 

✔️ Deployed the Solidity Contract on Etherlink and Sepholia


## Requirements:
* Node JS
* Metamask wallet
* Flask to run ML service

## Getting Started with Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the results.

To interact with the blockchain network, users are expected to have a Sepholia account with test credits.
